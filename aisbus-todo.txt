+ TaggingTransformerConfiguration
	AisPacketTagging cannot be used without transformer
	
+ Consider to have static method on configuration classes that creates
  instances instead of in AisBusFactory!!!

+ Tagging solution	
	AisBus handle tagging and configuration

+ File provider (with replay functionality)
	
+ AisPacketReader retry 
	
+ AisBusLauncher in utils that takes conf file as argument

+ ais-utils single jar, shell scripts and log4j xml   

+ Filter refactor
	- Specific GH tag filter
	- Target country filter
	- Metadata filter
	
+ Filter configurations
	
+ Replay file provider (or implement as a filter or transformer)

+ Logging

+ Thread handling. Maybe each component must implement a getThread and component provide 
  protected setThread.

+ Handle interruption

+ Remove consumer/provider

+ Overflow handling

+ Statistics / Status object on components

+ Search for all TODO's


+ Testing

+ Findbugs and checkstyle

DONE + AisReader source name handling by transformer

+ AisPacket/AisStore and source name. Use tranformer and policy PREPEND_MISSING

+ Refacor current AisBus/AisView setup (also use new tagging)

+ Why ais-communication and ais-message ?
